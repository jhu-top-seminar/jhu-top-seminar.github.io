    <div class="title"> The algebraic K theory of type 2 spectra </div>
<div class="abstract"> The algebraic K theory of the category of finite type n spectra is a fundamental object containing structural information about the stable homotopy category. However, until recently almost nothing was known about it for n>1, primarily because it is not the K theory of a connective ring. In this talk I will explain how, for n=2, it can be computed in terms of K theory of discrete rings and topological cyclic homology. In particular, we can read off the K groups in low degrees and find that there is an infinite family of 2-torsion classes in K_0 at the prime 2. I will also explain how to construct type 2 spectra representing these K_0 classes.</div>

<div class="title"> Global Spectra via Lax Limits </div>
<div class="abstract"> Global stable homotopy theory is a formalism which admits applications to orbifold cohomology, elliptic cohomology and importantly equivariant stable homotopy theory. Many important equivariant spectra admit global refinements, and these refinements have led to theoretical advances and have aided in calculations. In fact global homotopy theory is often described as "G-equivariant homotopy theory for all (compact Lie) groups G at the same time". In this talk I will present a result which makes this informal statement precise by explaining exactly how the infinity category of global spectra is built from the infinity categories of G-spectra for all G. Namely it is a partially lax limit of a diagram indexing the infinity categories of G-spectra, which is lax on the surjections and strict on the injections. (The work presented is joint with Denis Nardin and Luca Pol)</div>

<div class="title"> Foams, Tait colorings, and link homology </div>
<div class="abstract">Several approaches to link homology utilize foams, which are cobordisms in 3D between planar graphs. To a planar graph one assigns a state space and to a foam -- a map between the state spaces of its boundaries. We review a construction of these state spaces which uses a rather subtle evaluation of closed foams. The resulting theory is connected to the SL(3) link homology, the four-color theorem, and the Kronheimer-Mrowka homology theory.  </div>

<div class="title"> E_n algebras from physics </div>
<div class="abstract">What mathematicians and physicists mean by ``topological field theory'' do not match perfectly, as there are physical examples (like BF theory) that do not fit directly into the Atiyah-Segal framework. Nonetheless, if one constructs rigorously standard examples from physics (including BF and Chern-Simons theories), one obtains E_n algebras, a notion introduced to capture the structure of n-fold based loop spaces, and hence one opens up a new conduit of dialogue between physics and higher algebra. This talk will overview this relationship, some of its consequences, and some possibilities that it opens up. No background in physics will be needed to follow the talks; all examples can and will be explained in mathematical terms. </div>

<div class="title"> The Real-oriented cohomology of infinite stunted projective spaces </div>
<div class="abstract"> Real-oriented cohomology theories $E\mathbb{R}$ are $C_2$-equivariant theories which are, informally, associated to the inversion on the formal group law of a complex-oriented cohomology theory $E$. Their spectra $ER$ of fixed points give higher chromatic analogues of real $K$-theory, and detect interesting $2$-torsion phenomena in stable homotopy theory. 

In this talk, I will discuss the structure of the $ER$-cohomology of the infinite stunted real projective spectra $\mathbb{R}P^\infty_j$ in the Landweber exact case, focusing on some tools that go into the computation and what it tells us about Real spectra and $C_2$-equivariant homotopy theory.

<div class="title"> Equivariant enumerative geometry </div>
<div class="abstract">Classical enumerative geometry asks geometric questions of the form "how many?" and expects an integral answer. For example, how many circles can we draw tangent to a given three? How many lines lie on a cubic surface? The fact that these questions admit well-defined integral answers independent upon the initial parameters of the problem is Schubert’s principle of conservation of number. In this talk we will outline a program of "equivariant enumerative geometry", which wields equivariant homotopy theory to explore enumerative questions in the presence of symmetry. Our main result is an equivariant conservation result, which states that, under nice hypotheses, the sum of regular representations of the orbits of solutions to an equivariant enumerative problem is conserved. As an application, we explore the orbits of the 27-lines on an S_4-symmetric cubic. </div>

In particular, I will review the Atiyah-Segal completion theorem, and following Grojnowski, Greenlees, Lurie, Gepner-Meier, and others, I'll explain how this can be used as motivation to define generalized equivariant cohomology using derived algebraic geometry.</div>

<div class="title">Dirac geometry</div>
<div class="abstract">The rings which appear naturally in derived contexts, for example as homology of differential graded algebras, are graded-commutative in the Koszul sense; that is, odd degree elements anticommute. In this talk, I will describe joint work with Lars Hesselholt where we develop algebraic geometry built out of such rings, which we call Dirac geometry. The latter can be considered as a natural extension of G_m-equivariant algebraic geometry where the Serre twist has a square-root. I will describe some applications to the theory of motives and stable homotopy theory.  </div>

<div class="title"> Title: An algebraic description of principal 2-group bundles </div>
<div class="abstract"> Abstract: 2-groups are a categorification of groups. We focus on 2-groups that are categorical central extensions of a finite group classified by a 3-cocycle, and study principal 2-group bundles over a manifold X. In this talk, we will introduce 2-groups with several examples. We'll then use a completely algebraic description of the bicategory of flat 2-group bundles on X to compare them to the classical moduli space of G-bundles on X. We'll also discuss how this relates to the Freed-Quinn line bundle from Chern-Simons theory. This is joint work with Dan Berwick-Evans, Emily Cliff, Laura Murray, and Apurva Nakade. </div>

<div class="title"> Title: Multiplicative Motivic Infinite Loop Space Theory </div>
<div class="abstract"> Abstract: From a spectrum E one can extract its infinite loop space Omega^\infty E = X. The space X comes rich with structure. What exactly is all of this structure? The recognition principle for infinite loop spaces gives the following answer: the structure of an infinite loop space is exactly the structure of a grouplike E_\infty monoid. What's more, this identification respects multiplicative structures. In this talk, I'd like to discuss the analogue of this story in the setting of motivic homotopy theory. We'll review the symmetric monoidal recognition principle for motivic infinite loop spaces of Elmanto--Hoyois--Khan--Sosnilo--Yakerson, and discuss an extension of the theory that goes beyond symmetric monoidality to incorporate Bachmann--Hoyois' theory of norms. </div>

<div class="title"> Title: Towards knot homology for 3-manifolds </div>
<div class="abstract"> Abstract: The Jones polynomial is an invariant of knots in R^3. Following a proposal of Witten, it was extended to knots in 3-manifolds by Reshetikhin--Turaev using quantum groups.
<br></br>
Khovanov homology is a categorification of the Jones polynomial of a knot in R^3, analogously to how ordinary homology is a categorification of the Euler characteristic of a space. It is a major open problem to extend Khovanov homology to knots in 3-manifolds.
<br></br>
In this talk, I will explain forthcoming work towards solving this problem, joint with Leon Liu, David Reutter, Catharina Stroppel, and Paul Wedrich. Roughly speaking, our contribution amounts to the first instance of a braiding on 2-representations of a categorified quantum group. More precisely, we construct a braided (∞,2)-category that simultaneously incorporates all of Rouquier's braid group actions on Hecke categories in type A, articulating a novel compatibility among them. </div>

<div class="title"> Title: Grothendieck-Teichmüller theory and modular operads </div>
<div class="abstract"> Abstract: The absolute Galois group of the rationals Gal(Q) is one of the most important concepts in number theory. Although we cannot explicitly describe more than two elements in this infinite group, we know it acts on well-known algebraic and topological objects in compatible ways. Grothendieck-Teichmüller theory uses these representations to study this Galois group. One of the most important representations comes from the compatible actions of Gal(Q) on all the profinite mapping class groups of surfaces. In this talk, we introduce an algebraic tool called an infinity modular operad and use it to construct an infinity modular operad of surfaces capturing the compatibility structure above. We show this admits an action of Gal(Q), translating the Grothendieck-Teichmüller program into the theory of infinity modular operads, which provides new ideas and tools to approach this problem. This is joint work with Marcy Robertson. </div>

<div class="title"> Title: Configuration spaces of surfaces </div>
<div class="abstract"> Abstract: Framed configuration spaces of a surface form a right module over the framed little disks operad. This rich algebraic structure has important consequences, for example for the computations of manifold calculus or factorization homology. Determining the homotopy type of this operadic right module remains however a difficult task. In this talk, I will explain how to compute the rational homotopy type for oriented compact surfaces. The result is a finite-dimensional purely combinatorial model. The proof involves several ingredients: Kontsevich’s formality, Tamarkin’s formality, and the cyclic formality of the framed little disks operad.

<div class="abstract"> Abstract: Initial developments of factorization homology abstract the global observables of perturbative TQFTs, in which global observables are determined by point-observables/operators.  In this talk, I'll discuss an upgrade of factorization homology tailored for a larger class of TQFTs, in which global observables are determined by point- and line-observables/operators — the discussion will be focused on low-dimensions, where it's related to Skein-modules.  A key technical construction is an action of \Omega O(3) on each rigid braided-monoidal (\infty,1)-category.  I find this construction fun, so will give space for it in the talk.

<div class="title"> Title: Localizations in symplectic geometry (or, toward a world where Fukaya categories help study stable homotopy theory)

 </div>
<div class="abstract"> Abstract: One of the great applications of infinity-categories is the ability to compute localizations without model categories. We apply this to prove a surprising result in symplectic geometry: A certain 1-category of symplectic manifolds localizes to an infinity-category that computes the homotopy type of the correct geometric mapping spaces! Even better, one can construct a further localization that (conjecturally) allows for purely symplectic constructions of localizations of the stable homotopy category. This is based on joint work with Oleg Lazarev and Zack Sylvan. </div>

<div class="title">When free algebras are not flat and other oddities of equivariant algebra </div>
<div class="abstract">Abstract: In equivariant stable homotopy theory, we replace homotopy groups with homotopy Mackey functors. In many ways, the category of Mackey functors behaves like the category of abelian groups, but the analogy is not perfect. These differences can be a real headache for computations, but they also reflect how much richer the equivariant world can be. In this talk, we will explore several surprising differences between algebra with Mackey functors and algebra as you know it. </div>

<div class="title">Title:  Geometric cochains and the phenotypics of homotopy theory</div>
<div class="abstract">Abstract: (joint with Greg Friedman and Anibal Medina)
  
Interplay between discrete and continuous, combinatorial and geometric, digital and analog has always been at the heart of topology.  This was expressed  by Sullivan, who likened homotopy types with genetic codes, both being discrete data with continuous expressions, as he made remarkable progress in both homotopy theory and smooth topology.  We are developing geometric cochains as a way, conjecturally, to provide an E-infinity algebra model - and thus homotopy model, by Mandell’s Theorem - for smooth manifolds through their differential topology.  This would provide a phenotypical determination of the genetics of a manifold.
  <br></br>
Geometric cochains are a smooth version of Chow theory, developed just in the last decade by gauge theorists such as Lipyanskiy and Joyce.  The theory could have been defined alongside all of the classical cohomology theories, but there are technical obstacles.   With manifolds with boundaries being needed for chain complex structure, and the natural product being intersection or more generally fiber product, one is quickly led to working with manifolds with corners.  Moreover, the product requires transversality and thus is partially defined, as called for if it is to be commutative while modeling some inherently E-infinity algebra.   In work being written, we set the foundations of this theory.  Our original motivation for studying such a theory was pedagogical - teaching basic and intermediate algebraic topology - and we indicate some of those applications.

Recently posted work provides a proof of concept, where we bind the combinatorially defined cup product to the geometrically defined fiber product when both are in play - namely on a manifold with a smooth cubulation or triangulation.  We do this through an almost-canonical vector field on a cubulated manifold, whose flow interpolates between the usual geometric diagonal and the Serre diagonal.
  <br></br>
In the combinatorial setting, choices for resolving lack of commutativity at the cochain level give rise to an E-infinity structure.  We think that choices for resolving lack of transversality give rise to a partially defined E-infinity structure on geometric cochains.  In particular, we have an explicit conjecture for a partially defined action of the Fulton-MacPherson operad on geometric cochains.  We hope to connect with experts on partially defined algebras and related matters to help resolve technicalities in this program.

<div class="title"> Elliptic cohomology and derived algebraic geometry </div>
<div class="abstract">Abstract: Elliptic cohomology (a.k.a. topological modular forms) originated in mathematical physics, specifically in the study of elliptic genera and elliptic operators on the free loop space. In its modern incarnation, elliptic cohomology is a cohomology theory which is both powerful and computable. It is, in a certain precise sense, one level higher than topological K-theory, with which it shares many features, though it is simultaneously stronger and more mysterious.
  <br></br>
In this talk we will explain Lurie's construction of elliptic cohomology via derived algebraic geometry and exploit this construction to make some computations in elliptic cohomology. In particular, we will show that the elliptic cohomology of the unitary groups can be calculated as the space of functions on the Hilbert scheme associated to a derived elliptic curve, and discuss how this is approximated by functions on symmetric powers of the underlying ordinary elliptic curve.

<div class="title"> Title: From formal geometry to the dual Steenrod algebra (and not the other way around)
 </div>
<div class="abstract"> Abstract: Chromatic homotopy theory embraces the philosophy that formal geometry (the algebraic study of certain power series) exerts a huge amount of control over stable homotopy theory. One of the starting points of this philosophy is a theorem (due to Milnor) that the dual Steenrod algebra (a kind of automorphism group for mod 2 homology) coincides with the automorphism group of the formal additive group (the wonderful power series F(x,y)= x + y). To date, all proofs of this theorem require some amount of calculate-both-sides-and-see-that-they-agree type of arguments, making the connection between formal geometry and stable homotopy theory look kind of coincidental. In this talk I will present a remedy to the situation, where the dual Steenrod algebra is identified within formal geometry in an abstract/conceptual way, with the benefit of avoiding complicated spectral sequence calculations, Steenrod operations, and complicated formulas. In fact I will almost never even write an algebra by generators and relations. If there is time (no chance) I will discuss odd primes and other algebras of cohomology operations. </div>

<div class="title"> Title: The higher characteristic polynomial </div>
<div class="abstract"> Abstract: Let f be a self-map of a finite CW complex. The algebraic count of the periodic points of f can be organized to a power series, the Lefschetz zeta function. The same data is encoded by the characteristic polynomial of the action of f on homology. In this talk I'll discuss how the correct "higher" version of this zeta function is the Dennis trace map, but from K-theory of endomorphisms to topological restriction homology. Above pi_0, this captures algebraic counts of families of periodic points, and we can represent the information they capture pictorially. Much of this is joint work with Campbell, Lind, Ponto, and Zakharevich. </div>

<div class="title"> Title: Cofibrantly Generated Model Structures for Functor Calculus </div>
<div class="abstract"> Abstract: Many objects of interest in algebraic topology may be viewed as functors, which often makes them difficult to analyze directly. Functor calculus provides a means by which to approximate a certain type of functor F with a tower of `degree n' functors under F that is analogous to the Taylor series of a function. However, each type of functor calculus differs in its notion of what it means for a functor to be degree n, and in the type of functor to which it applies.
<br></br>
I will present results necessary for developing a more universal framework for functor calculus. As a first example we show how the discrete functor calculus of Bauer, Johnson and McCarthy may be placed into the context of simplicial model categories, allowing for a direct comparison to Goodwillie's original functor calculus. 
<br></br>
This is joint work with Julia Bergner, Lauren Bandklayder, Brenda Johnson and Rekka Santhanam.

<div class="title">From power operations to E-infinity maps</div>
<div class="abstract">A general heuristic in homotopy theory tells us that by understanding the operations which act naturally on the homotopy groups of a class of objects, one can build obstruction theories and so forth for working with these objects. For instance, in the setting of highly structured ring spectra, this heuristic leads one to obstruction theories built on top of power operations. In this talk I'll describe a general framework that makes it easy to set up these kinds of obstruction theories, focusing on the particular example of K(n)-local E-infinity algebras over a Morava E-theory. I'll explain how the picture one obtains is very pleasant at heights 1 and 2, and in particular can be applied to produce new E-infinity complex orientations.</div>

<div class="title">Analogs of Dirichlet $L$-functions in chromatic homotopy theory</div>
<div class="abstract"> <p>
   In the 1960’s, Adams computed the image of the $J$-homomorphism in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The image of $J$ in $\pi_{4k-1}^s(S^0)$ is a cyclic group whose order is equal to the denominator of $\zeta(1-2k)/2$ (up to a factor of $2$). The goal of this talk is to introduce a family of Dirichlet J-spectra that generalizes this connection.
   </p>
   <p>
We will start by reviewing Adams’s computation of the image of $J$. Using motivations from modular forms, we construct a family of Dirichlet $J$-spectra for each Dirichlet character. When conductor of the character is an odd prime $p$, the $p$-completion of the Dirichlet $J$-spectra splits as a wedge sum of $K(1)$-local invertible spectra. These summands are elements of finite orders in the $K(1)$-local Picard group.
   </p>
   <p>
We will then introduce a spectral sequence to compute homotopy groups of the Dirichlet $J$-spectra. The $1$-line in this spectral sequence is closely related to congruences of certain Eisenstein series. This explains appearance of special values of Dirichlet $L$-functions in the homotopy groups of these Dirichlet $J$-spectra. Finally, we establish a Brown-Comenetz duality for the Dirichlet $J$-spectra that resembles the functional equations of the corresponding Dirichlet $L$-functions. In this sense, the Dirichlet $J$-spectra we constructed are analogs of Dirichlet $L$-functions in chromatic homotopy theory.</div>

One of the $v_1$−self-maps of Y can be lifted to a $C_2$ equivariant self-map as well as a real-motivic self-map. Further, the cofiber of the self-map of the R-motivic lift of Y is a realization of the real-motivic Steenrod subalgebra A(1). This is joint work with Prasit Bhattacharya and Bertrand Guillou.</div>

<div class="abstract">We describe a new model structure on the category of cubical sets with connections whose cofibrations are the monomorphisms and whose fibrant objects are defined by the right lifting property with respect to inner open boxes, the cubical analogue of inner horns. We discuss the proof that this model structure is Quillen equivalent to the Joyal model structure on simplicial sets via the triangulation functor, and a new theory of cones in cubical sets which is used in this proof. We also introduce the homotopy category and mapping spaces of a fibrant cubical set, and characterize weak equivalences between fibrant cubical sets in terms of these concepts.

   In this talk, I will introduce the Chow t-structure on the motivic stable homotopy category over a general base field. This t-structure is a generalization of the Chow-Novikov t-structure defined on a p-completed cellular motivic module category in work of Gheorghe--Wang--Xu.<br>
Moreover, we identify the heart of this t-structure with a purely algebraic category, and expand the results of Gheorghe-Wang-Xu to integral results on the entire motivic category over general base fields. This leads to computational applications on determining the Adams spectral sequences in the classical stable homotopy category, as well as that in the motivic stable homotopy category over C, R, and F_p. This is joint work with Tom Bachmann, Guozhen Wang and Zhouli Xu.

<div class="title">Tate blueshift for real oriented cohomology</div>
<div class="abstract">This is joint work with Guchuan Li and Vitaly Lorman. The Johnson--Wilson spectra $E(n)$ play a fundamental role in chromatic homotopy theory. In the late 90's, Ando--Morava--Sadofsky showed that the Tate construction with respect to a trivial $\mathbb{Z}/p$-action on $E(n)$ splits into a wedge of $E(n-1)$'s. I will describe a $C_2$-equivariant lift of this result involving the Real Johnson--Wilson theories $E\mathbb{R}(n)$ studied by Hu--Kriz and Kitchloo--Lorman--Wilson. Our result simultaneously generalizes the work of Ando--Morava--Sadofsky (by taking underlying spectra) and a classical Tate splitting for real topological K-theory proven by Greenlees--May (by taking $C_2$-fixed points). I also plan to discuss a key technical ingredient, the parametrized Tate construction (developed by Quigley--Shah), which can be thought of as a "twisted" Tate construction for $C_2$-spectra.  </div>

Berwick-Evans which turns Segal's physically-inspired suggestions into rigorous cocycles for the case of equivariant elliptic cohomology over the complex numbers, with some focus on the role of supersymmetry on allowing for the possibility of rigorous mathematical definition. As time permits, I hope to indicate towards the end how one might naturally extend these ideas to higher genus.</div>

<div class="title">$\mathbb Z$-homotopy fixed points of Real and hyperreal spectra</div>
<div class="abstract">Work of Kitchloo--Wilson and Kitchloo--Lorman--Wilson has shown how one can readily compute with the Real Johnson--Wilson theories. These higher chromatic height lifts of Atiyah's Real K-theory serve as approximations to the Fujii--Landweber Real bordism spectrum $MU_{\mathbb R}$ in the same way that the ordinary Johnson--Wilson theories approximate $MU$. Motivated by work of Bousfield on his unified K-theory, Mingcong Zeng and I studied the \(\mathbb Z\)-homotopy fixed points for these spectra, plugging them into an analogous framework. Viewing the problem slightly more generally, one can also very easily compute the \(\mathbb Z\)-homotopy fixed points for any of the norms of $MU_{\mathbb R}$ and the various chromatic localizations. Along the way, I'll present another way to use the slice filtration to study these kinds of questions.</div>

Both $K$- and $L$-theory are difficult to compute in general and assembly maps give important information about these functors. Ranicki and Weiss developed a combinatorial version of assembly by describing $L$-theory over additive bordism categories indexed over simplicial complexes. In this talk, I will present current work with Jim Davis where we define an equivariant version of Ranicki’s local / global assembly map and identify our local / global assembly map with the map on equivariant homology defined by Davis and Lueck.

<div class="title">A  $2$-local finite spectrum that admits $1$-periodic $v_2$-self-map</div>
<div class="abstract"> One can learn a lot about the stable homotopy groups of spheres by understanding the homotopy groups of interesting finite CW-spectra and their periodic self-maps. For example, Mark Mahowald showed that the spectrum $Y= \mathbb{RP}^2 \wedge \mathbb{CP}^2$ admits a periodic self-map, which can be used to produce an infinite family in the chromatic layer one of the $2$-primary stable homotopy groups of spheres. Mark Mahowald, used the spectrum $Y$ to prove the height $1$ prime $2$ telescope conjecture. In this talk, I will introduce a a $2$-local spectrum $Z$ which admits a $1$-periodic $v_2$-self-map and can be regarded as the height $2$ analogue of the spectrum $Y$ (joint with P.Egger).  We will discuss some of its notable properties. I will discuss the calculation of the $K(2)$-local homotopy groups of $Z$. I will also discuss some of the key features of the $tmf$-resolution of $Z$ and what we need to analyze in the $tmf$-resolution to prove or to disprove the telescope conjecture at the chromatic height 2 prime 2 (joint with Beaudry, Behrens, Culver and Xu). </div>

<div class="title">COTORSION PAIRS AND A K-THEORY LOCALIZATION THEOREM</div>
<div class="abstract">Cotorsion pairs were introduced in the ’70s as a generalization of projective and injective objects in an abelian category, and were mainly used in the context of representation theory. In 2002, Hovey showed a remarkable correspondence between compatible cotorsion pairs on an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ and abelian model structures one can define on $\mathcal{A}$. These include, for example, the projective and injective model structures on chain complexes.
<br>
In this talk, we turn our attention to Waldhausen categories, and explain how cotorsion pairs can be used to construct Waldhausen structures on an exact category, with the usual class of admissible monomorphisms as cofibrations, and some freedom to choose the class of desired acyclic objects. This allows us to prove a new version of Quillen’s localization theorem, relating the K-theory of exact categories $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{B}$ to that of a cofiber, constructed
through a cotorsion pair.</div>

<div class="title">Duality in homotopy theory</div>
<div class="abstract"> We explore some implications of a fact hiding in plain sight: Namely, the $n$-sphere has the remarkable property that the “swap” map $\sigma: S^n \wedge S^n \to S^n \wedge S^n$ can be “untwisted”: it is homotopic to $(-1)^n \wedge 1$. This simple fact remains true in equivariant and motivic contexts.
<br>
One consequence is a structural fact about symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories with finite colimits and duals for objects: it turns out that any such category splits as the product of three canonical subcategories (for instance, one of these subcategories is characterized by being stable).
<br>
As another consequence, we show that for any finite abelian group $G$, the symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category of genuine finite $G$-spectra is obtained from finite $G$-spaces by stabilizing and freely adjoining duals for objects. This universal property vindicates one motivation sometimes given for studying genuine $G$-spectra: namely that genuine $G$-spectra (unlike naive $G$-spectra or Borel $G$-spectra) have a good theory of Spanier-Whitehead duality. We take steps toward a similar universal property for nonabelian groups and also in motivic homotopy theory.

<div class="title">Loop space constructions of elliptic cohomology</div>
<div class="abstract">Elliptic cohomology is a generalised cohomology theory related to elliptic curves, which was introduced in the late 1980s. An important motivation for its introduction was to help understand index theory for families of differential operators over free loop spaces. However, for a long time the only known constructions of elliptic cohomology were purely algebraic, and the precise connection to free loop spaces remained obscure. In this talk, I will summarise two constructions of complex analytic, equivariant elliptic cohomology: one from the K-theory of free loop spaces, and one from the ordinary cohomology of double free loop spaces. I will also describe a Chern character-type map from the former to the latter, as well as the relationship to Kitchloo's twisted equivariant elliptic cohomology theory.

<div class="title">On the homotopy theory of stratified spaces</div>
<div class="abstract">A natural question arises when working with intersection cohomology and other stratified invariants of singular manifolds: what is the correct stable homotopy theory for these invariants to live in? But before answering that question, one first has to identify the correct unstable homotopy theory of stratified spaces. The exit-path category construction of MacPherson, Treumann, and Lurie provides functor from suitably nice stratified topological spaces to "abstract stratified homotopy types” — ∞-categories with a conservative functor to a poset. Work of Ayala–Francis–Rozenblyum even shows that their conically smooth stratified topological spaces embed into the ∞-category of abstract stratified homotopy types. We explain how to go further and produce an equivalence between the homotopy theory of all stratified topological spaces and these abstract stratified homotopy types. We discuss how this new viewpoint provides a space for stratified homotopy invariants in algebraic geometry as well, which was the topic of recent work with Barwick and Glasman. This is the first step of work in progress with Barwick on understanding stable stratified homotopy invariants.</div>

<div class="title">The equivariant stable parametrized h-cobordism theorem</div>
<div class="abstract">The stable parametrized h-cobordism theorem provides a critical link in the chain of homotopy theoretic constructions that show up in the classification of manifolds and their diffeomorphisms. For a compact smooth manifold M it gives a decomposition of Waldhausen's A(M) into QM_+ and a delooping of the stable h-cobordism space of M. I will talk about joint work with Malkiewich on this story when M is a smooth compact G-manifold.

<div class="title">The algebra of stable 2-types</div>
<div class="abstract">This talk will describe recent work using symmetric monoidal 2-categories to build algebraic models of stable homotopy 2-types (equivalently, 3-connected 6-types).  We will describe a dictionary between homotopy-theoretic constructions among stable 2-types and algebraic constructions among symmetric monoidal 2-categories.  As applications, we obtain a model for the 2-type of the sphere and the 2-type of algebraic K-theory spectra.  This work is joint with Nick Gurski and Angélica Osorno.

This framework of "shadows" has wide application, in particular to algebraic K-theory and fixed point theory. In this talk I'll discuss another application: proving a very general Lefschetz fixed point theorem that recovers ones of Lunts, Shklyarov, and Cisinski-Tabuada. Time permitting, I'll discuss further applications to Topological Hochschild Homology (THH) and Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel theory. This is work joint with Kate Ponto.</div>

<div class="title">Tangent ∞-categories and Goodwillie calculus</div>
<div class="abstract">Goodwillie calculus is a set of tools in homotopy theory developed, to some extent, by analogies with ordinary differential calculus. The goal of this talk is to make that analogy precise by describing a common higher-category-theoretic framework that includes both the calculus of smooth maps between manifolds, and the calculus of functors, as examples. This framework is based on the notion of "tangent category" introduced first by Rosicky and recently developed by Cockett and Cruttwell in connection with models of differential calculus in logic. In joint work with Kristine Bauer and Matthew Burke (both at Calgary) we generalize to tangent structures on an (∞,2)-category and show that the (∞,2)-category of presentable ∞-categories possesses such a structure. This allows us to make precise, for example, the intuition that the ∞-category of spectra plays the role of the real line in Goodwillie calculus. As an application we show that Goodwillie's definition of n-excisive functor can be recovered purely from the tangent structure in the same way that n-jets of smooth maps are in ordinary calculus. If time permits, I will suggest how other concepts from differential geometry, such as connections, may play out into the context of functor calculus.

<div class="title"> Classifying spaces for commutativity</div>
<div class="abstract">In this talk I’ll give a brief summary of the most important results on the theory of classifying spaces for commutativity for a topological group G, denoted BcomG. The second part of the talk will treat TC structures: There is a natural inclusion of BcomG into the classifying space BG, and a natural question is when does the classifying map of a G-bundle lifts to BcomG. A homotopy class of such a lift is called “Transitionally Commutative” (TC) structure. In recent work with O. Antolín-Camarena, S. Gritschacher and D. Ramras we have constructed characteristic classes for the example cases of the orthogonal groups O(n) (but mostly O(2)), that give obstructions to such structures. </div>

<div class="abstract"> I will present a model category structure that encodes the homotopy theory of (small) homotopy functors, from a combinatorial model category to simplicial sets. The fibrant objects are the homotopy functors, i.e. functors that preserve weak equivalences. Next, I will explain how the homotopy theory of homotopy functors is homotopy invariant, i.e. a Quillen equivalence on domain categories induces a Quillen equivalence on homotopy functor categories. I will demonstrate the importance of this result with examples drawn from numerous fields, including spaces, spectra, chain complexes, simplicial presheaves, motivic spectra, infinity categories, and infinity operads. This is joint work with Boris Chorny.

<div class="title">K-theory of endomorphisms, Witt vectors, and cyclotomic spectra</div>
<div class="abstract"> There is an endofunctor of the category of categories which associates to a category C the category End(C) of endomorphisms of objects of C. If C is a stable infinity category then End(C) is as well, and the associated K-theory spectrum KEnd(C):=K(End(C)) is called the K-theory of endomorphisms of C. Using calculations of Almkvist together with the theory of noncommutative motives, we classify equivalence classes of endofunctors of KEnd in terms of a noncompeleted version of the Witt vectors of the polynomial ring Z[t], answering a question posed by Almkvist in the 70s. As applications, we obtain various lifts of Witt rings to the sphere spectrum as well as a more structured version of the cyclotomic trace via cyclic K-theory, as studied in recent work of Kaledin and Nikolaus-Scholze.

Under appropriate conditions we can get a Whitehead-type theorem for the original &#x221e;-category, in which homotopy groups are replaced by homotopy groupoids, and even a Brown representability theorem, constructing objects of the original &#x221e;-category from this purely categorical data. These conditions hold notably for the &#x221e;-categories of spaces and of small &#x221e;-categories.

<div class="title">The geometry of the cyclotomic trace</div>
<div class="abstract">K-theory is a means of probing geometric objects by studying their vector bundles, i.e. parametrized families of vector spaces.  Algebraic K-theory, the version applying to varieties and schemes, is a particularly deep and far-reaching invariant, but it is notoriously difficult to compute.  The primary means of computing it is through its "cyclotomic trace" map K→TC to another theory called topological cyclic homology.  However, despite the enormous computational success of these so-called "trace methods" in algebraic K-theory computations, the algebro-geometric nature of the cyclotomic trace has remained mysterious. <br>

In this talk, I will describe a new construction of TC that affords a precise interpretation of the cyclotomic trace at the level of derived algebraic geometry.  This rests of a reinterpretation of genuine-equivariant homotopy theory in terms of stratified geometry (following Glasman and others).  This represents joint work with David Ayala and Nick Rozenblyum.  By the end of the talk, you will be able to take home with you a very nice and down-to-earth fact about traces of matrices.  If there is time, I will also indicate joint work with Reuben Stern on a 2-dimensional version of this story that applies to "2-traces" for the 2-vector bundles of Baas--Dundas--Rognes.

<div class="abstract">In the 50s <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~jack/">Milnor</a> defined invariants of multi-component linked circles in three-space as a generalization of the linking number in order to capture higher-order linking phenomena not detected by the linking number, such as the linking of the <a href="http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/node/1906443/print">Borromean</a> rings. In the early 90s <a href="http://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/rmi/topologie/">Koschorke</a> generalized Milnor’s invariants to linking of higher-dimensional spheres in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The invariants are no longer numbers, but rather elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. I will present a generalization of Koschorke’s work to linking of arbitrary manifolds in Euclidean space. Here the invariants are points in the zero space of a Thom spectrum, are induced by a map of spaces rather than defined on the group level, and they are a part of an EHP-like sequence which naturally arises in the study of the Taylor tower of the identity functor in <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/faculty/goodwillie.html">Goodwillie</a>’s homotopy calculus. A key feature of our generalization is that the invariants are “multirelative”. In particular, the classical linking number is really a relative invariant.

<div class="abstract">Persistent homology is a topological method for measuring the shapes of spaces and features of functions. One of its most important applications is to point clouds, where shape is usually interpreted as the geometry of some implicit underlying object near which the point cloud is sampled. Time-delay embeddings, on the other hand, have been used mostly in the study of time series and dynamical systems to understand the nature of their attractors. In this talk we analyze the geometry and topology of time-delay embeddings through the lens of persistent homology. In particular, we study maximum persistence as a measure of periodicity at the signal level, present structural theorems for the resulting diagrams, and derive estimates for their dependency on the window size and embedding dimension. Time permitting, some biological applications will be presented.</div>

A natural question then is: what sort of logic can we use to reason about these “spaces”?

<div class="speaker"><a href="http://dwhite03.web.wesleyan.edu/">David White</a>, Wesleyan</div>
<div class="abstract">We give conditions on a monoidal model category <i>M</i> and on a set of maps <i>S</i> so that the <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu/people/profile?netid=bous">Bousfield</a> localization of <i>M</i> with respect to <i>S</i> preserves the structure of algebras over various operads. This problem was motivated by an example due to <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~mah7cd">Mike Hill</a> which demonstrates that for the model category of equivariant spectra, even very nice localizations can fail to preserve commutativity. As a special case of our general machinery we characterize which localizations preserve genuine equivariant commutativity. Our results are general enough to hold for non-cofibrant operads as well, and we will demonstrate this via a treatment of when localization preserve strict commutative monoids. En route we will introduce the commutative monoid axiom, which guarantees us that commutative monoids inherit a model structure. If there is time we will say a word about the generalizations of this axiom to other non-cofibrant operads, and about how these generalized axioms interact with Bousfield localization.</div>

We will also give an application of these results, to show that <a href="http://math.northwestern.edu/people/facultyProfiles/dmitry.tamarkin.html">Tamarkin</a>’s construction of formality morphisms is equivariant with respect to the action of the <a href="http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/de/laureate/alexander-grothendieck/">Grothendieck</a>-Teichmüller group.</div>

<div class="speaker"><a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~church/">Tom Church</a>, Stanford</div>
<div class="abstract">I will give a gentle survey of the theory of representation stability, viewed through the lens of its applications. I will focus on the recent “second wave” of applications outside the domain of classical representation theory. These applications include: homological stability for configuration spaces of manifolds; understanding the stable (and unstable) homology of arithmetic lattices; uniform generators for congruence subgroups and “congruence” subgroups; and distributional stability for random squarefree polynomials over finite fields.</div>

<div class="speaker"><a href="http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/reine/u/fabian.hebestreit/">Fabian Hebestreit</a>, Münster</div>
<div class="abstract">The basic question for my talk is whether a closed manifold admits a metric of positive scalar curvature and I will explain how this question reduces to calculations in certain cobordism rings, due to a result of <a href="http://www.ihes.fr/~gromov/">Gromov</a> and <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~blaine/">Lawson</a>. Following an overview of these calculations in the case of Spin-cobordism, where they were carried out by <a href="http://math.nd.edu/people/faculty/stephan-a-stolz/">Stolz</a> and <a href="https://www-m10.ma.tum.de/bin/view/Lehrstuhl/SvenFuehring">Führing</a>, I want to address their generalisation to the case of twisted Spin-cobordism, which is ongoing joint work of <a href="http://www.math.uni-muenster.de/u/joachim/">Joachim</a> and myself.

<div class="abstract">In this talk I will describe an approach to computing the homotopy groups of a spectrum <i>Q</i>(2), originally constructed by <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~mbehrens/">Mark Behrens</a> in an effort to clarify and extend previous work on the 3-primary <i>K</i>(2)-local sphere by <a href="http://www.math.kochi-u.ac.jp/katsumi/">Shimomura</a>, Yabe, <a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~pgoerss/">Goerss</a>, <a href="http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~henn/">Henn</a>, <a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?pid=165996488">Mahowald</a>, and <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~rezk/">Rezk</a>. The spectrum <i>Q</i>(2) is built using degree 2 isogenies of elliptic curves (hence the “2” in its name) and spectra related to TMF, and as such, is conjectured to have interesting number-theoretic properties that we will discuss.

<div class="abstract">Excited electrons in organic semiconductors and insulators form metastable states, known as excitons.

We formulate solutions to the Exciton Scattering equations (excitons) in terms of an intersection problem, and apply an index theorem to obtain a lower bound on the number of such excitons in a given system. This lower bound becomes exact when the molecule has long enough ‘arms’, or large translational symmetry.</div>

<div class="abstract">The universal elliptic cohomology theory, TMF, is expected to have a rich equivariant refinement related to categorified groups called 2-groups.

<div class="abstract"><a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~pgoerss/">Goerss</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Hopkins">Hopkins</a> obstruction theory is a tool for obtaining structured ring spectra from algebraic data. It was originally conceived as the main ingredient in the construction of <i>tmf</i>, although it’s since become useful in a number of other settings, for instance in setting up a “naive” theory of spectral algebraic geometry and in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/rognes/home.html">Rognes</a>’s Galois correspondence for commutative ring spectra. In this talk, I’ll give some background, explain in broad strokes how the obstruction theory is built, and then indicate how one might go about generalizing it to an arbitrary presentable ∞-category. This last part relies on the notion of a <i>model ∞-category</i> – that is, of an ∞-category equipped with a “model structure” – which provides a theory of resolutions internal to ∞-categories and which will hopefully prove to be of independent interest.</div>

<div class="title">Toward the Formal Theory of Higher Homotopical Categories</div>

<div class="abstract">One framework for stating and proving theorems in abstract homotopy theory uses quasi-categories (aka ∞-categories): for instance, the result of <a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~jnkf/">Francis</a> that homology theories for topological <i>n</i>-manifolds are equivalent to <i>n</i>-disk algebras is formalized in this language. The foundational category theory of quasi-categories is developed in thousands of pages of dense mathematics by <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Andre+Joyal">Joyal</a>, <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/">Lurie</a>, and others. Our project is to redevelop these foundations using techniques from formal category theory. We show that the accepted definitions (e.g., of equivalence, limits, adjunctions, cartesian fibrations) can be formulated inside the “homotopy 2-category” of quasi-categories. From this new perspective the proofs that they satisfy the expected relationships (e.g., that right adjoints preserve limits) mirror the classical categorical ones. Importantly, this 2-categorical work can also be applied to other homotopy 2-categories, e.g., for <i>n</i>-fold complete <a href="http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/people.php?personid=63">Segal</a> spaces, which were used by Lurie to prove the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/">Baez</a>-<a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/James+Dolan">Dolan</a> cobordism hypothesis.

<div class="abstract"><a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~fw/">Waldhausen</a> showed that the algebraic K-theory of the “spherical group ring” on the based loops of a manifold captures the stable concordance space of the manifold.

This talk explains recent work with <a href="http://pages.iu.edu/~mmandell/">Mike Mandell</a> that provides a complete calculation of the homotopy groups of K(S) in terms of the homotopy groups of K(<b>Z</b>), the sphere spectrum, and a certain Thom spectrum.</div>

<div class="abstract">Let <i>R</i> be a finite-dimensional regular local ring with maximal ideal <i>m</i>. The category of <i>m</i>-complete <i>R</i>-modules is not abelian, but it can be enlarged to an abelian category of so-called <i>L</i>-complete modules. This category is an abelian subcategory of the full category of <i>R</i>-modules, but it is not usually a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/world/europe/alexander-grothendieck-math-enigma-dies-at-86.html">Grothendieck</a> category. It is well known that a Grothendieck category always has a derived category, however, this is much more delicate for arbitrary abelian categories. In this talk, we will show that the derived category of the <i>L</i>-complete modules exists, and that it is in fact equivalent to a certain <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu/people/profile?netid=bous">Bousfield</a> localization of the full derived category of <i>R</i>. <i>L</i>-complete modules should be dual to <i>m</i>-torsion modules, which do form a Grothendieck category.

<div class="title">Localization Sequences in the Algebraic K-Theory of Ring Spectra</div>

<div class="abstract">The algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum encodes significant information in both homotopy theory and differential topology. <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~fw/">Waldhausen’s</a> chromatic convergence conjecture attempts to approximate K(S) by localizations K(L<sub><i>n</i></sub>S). The L<sub><i>n</i></sub>S are in turn approximated by the <a href="http://www.ms.uky.edu/~johnson/">Johnson</a>-<a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/~wsw/">Wilson</a> spectra E(<i>n</i>)=BP&lt;<i>n</i>&gt;[<i>v</i><sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>–1</sup>], and K(BP&lt;<i>n</i>&gt;) is in principle computable. This would lead inductively to information about K(E(<i>n</i>)), and hence K(S), via the conjectural fiber sequence K(BP&lt;<i>n</i>–1&gt;) → K(BP&lt;<i>n</i>&gt;) → K(E(<i>n</i>)). In this talk, I will define the ring spectra of interest and construct some actual localization sequences in their K-theory. I will then use trace methods to show that the actual fiber of K(BP&lt;<i>n</i>&gt;) → K(E(n)) differs from K(BP&lt;<i>n</i>–1&gt;), meaning that the situation is more complicated than was originally hoped.

<div class="title">Coassembly in Algebraic K-Theory</div>

<div class="abstract">The coassembly map allows us to approximate any contravariant homotopy-invariant functor by an excisive functor, i.e. one that behaves like a cohomology theory. We’ll apply this construction to <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~fw/">Waldhausen’s</a> algebraic K-theory of spaces, and its corresponding THH functor. The results are somewhat surprising: a certain dual form of the A-theory <a href="http://www.mi.ras.ru/~snovikov/">Novikov</a> conjecture is false, but when the space in question is the classifying space B<i>G</i> of a finite <i>p</i>-group, coassembly on THH is split surjective after <i>p</i>-completion. Even better, we can show that the coassembly map links up with the more familiar assembly map to produce the equivariant norm. As a result, we get some splitting theorems after K(<i>n</i>)-localization, and a surprising connection between the Whitehead group and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tate">Tate</a> cohomology. If there is time, we will also discuss related work on the equivariant structure of THH.</div>

<div class="abstract">The first definitions of equivariant algebraic K-theory were given in the early 1980’s by <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/fiedorowicz.1/">Fiedorowicz</a>, Hauschild and <a href="http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/">May</a>, and by <a href="http://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/blog/uninews/entry/bielefeld_mathematician_receives_china_s">Dress</a> and <a href="http://www.aderemikuku.com/">Kuku</a>; however these early space-level definitions only allowed trivial action on the input ring or category. Equivariant infinite loop space theory allows us to define spectrum level generalizations of the early definitions: we can encode a <i>G</i>-action (not necessarily trivial) on the input as a genuine <i>G</i>-spectrum.

I will discuss some of the subtleties involved in turning a ring or space with <i>G</i>-action into the right input for equivariant algebraic K-theory or A-theory, and some of the properties of the resulting equivariant algebraic K-theory <i>G</i>-spectrum. For example, our construction recovers as particular cases equivariant topological real and complex K-theory, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah">Atiyah’s</a> Real K-theory and statements previously formulated in terms of naive <i>G</i>-spectra for Galois extensions.

I will also briefly discuss recent developments in equivariant infinite loop space theory from joint work with <a href="http://www.ms.uky.edu/~guillou/">Guillou</a>, May and <a href="http://people.reed.edu/~aosorno/">Osorno</a> (e.g., multiplicative structures) that should have long-range applications to equivariant algebraic K-theory.

<div class="title">The Chromatic Splitting Conjecture at n=p=2</div>

<div class="abstract">I will discuss why the strongest form of <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mjh/">Hopkins’s</a> chromatic splitting conjecture, as stated by <a href="http://mhovey.web.wesleyan.edu/">Hovey</a>, cannot hold at chromatic level <i>n</i>=2 at the prime <i>p</i>=2. More precisely, let V(0) be the mod 2 Moore spectrum. I will give a summary of how one uses the duality resolution of <a href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/ibobkova/">Bobkova</a>, <a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~pgoerss/">Goerss</a>, <a href="http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~henn/">Henn</a>, Mahowald and <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~rezk/">Rezk</a> to show that π<sub><i>k</i></sub>L<sub>1</sub>L<sub>K(2)</sub>V(0) is not zero when <i>k</i> is congruent to 5 modulo 8. I explain how this contradicts the decomposition of L<sub>1</sub>L<sub>K(2)</sub>S predicted by the chromatic splitting conjecture.</div>

<div class="title">Analysing Grothendieck Ring of Varieties Using K-Theory</div>

<div class="abstract">The Grothendieck ring of varieties K<sub>0</sub>[V<sub>k</sub>] is defined to be the free abelian group generated by varieties, modulo the relation that for a closed subvariety <i>Y</i> of <i>X</i>, [<i>X</i>]=[<i>Y</i>]+[<i>X</i>\<i>Y</i>]. This ring is used extensively in motivic integration. There are two important structural questions about the ring:
<ol>
<li>If <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are two varieties such that [<i>X</i>]=[<i>Y</i>], are <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> birationally isomorphic?</li>
<li>Is the class of the affine line [<b>A</b><sup>1</sup>] a zero divisor?</li>
</ol>
In a recent paper, <a href="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~borisov/">Borisov</a> constructed an example showing that the answer to question 2 is “yes”; in a beautiful coincidence this construction also produced varieties <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> which show that the answer to question 1 is “no.” In this talk we will construct a spectrum K(V<sub>k</sub>) such that π<sub>0</sub>K(V<sub>k</sub>)=K<sub>0</sub>[V<sub>k</sub>], and such that the higher homotopy groups contain further geometric information. We will then analyze the structure of this spectrum to show that Borisov’s coincidence is not a coincidence at all, and that in fact the kernel of multiplication by [<b>A</b><sup>1</sup>] is generated by counterexamples to question 1.</div>

<div class="title">Equivariant Calculus of Functors</div>

<div class="abstract">Let <i>G</i> be a finite group. I will define “<i>J</i>-excision” of functors on pointed <i>G</i>-spaces, for every finite <i>G</i>-set <i>J</i>. When <i>J</i> is the trivial <i>G</i>-set with <i>n</i>-elements we recover <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/faculty/goodwillie.html">Goodwillie’s</a> definition of <i>n</i>-excision. When <i>J=G</i> we recover <a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/blumberg/">Blumberg’s</a> notion of equivariant excision. There are <i>J</i>-excisive approximations of homotopy functors which fit together into a “Taylor tree”. I will explain how “<i>J</i>-homogeneous” functors are classified by suitably equivariant spectra, and address some convergence issues of the Taylor tree.

<div class="title">Kitchloo’s Category of Symplectic Motives</div>

<div class="abstract">The geometric quantization program attempts to define a functor from classical mechanics (AKA symplectic geometry) to quantum systems; but it is known to have problems, associated to failure of transversality. <a href="http://www.ihes.fr/~maxim/">Kontsevich</a> has made progress in the related deformation quantization program, which is less intrinsically global.

<br/><a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/~nitu/">Kitchloo</a> [in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5720">arXiv:1204.5720</a>] defines a stabilized category of symplectic manifolds, with morphism objects enriched over spectra, analogous to the algebraic geometers’ motives. He identifies its associated ‘motivic group’ as the (Hopf-Galois, ring) spectrum defined by the topological Hochschild homology of a Thom spectrum associated to a certain Lagrangian Grassmannian. After tensoring with <b>Q</b>, this is remarkably like the motivic group Kontsevich finds acting on his deformation quantization constructions.

<div class="title">Topological Persistence via Category Theory</div>

<div class="abstract">Topological persistence originated as a strategy for measuring the topology of a statistical data set. The naive approach is to build a simplicial complex from the data and measure its homological invariants; but this approach is extremely sensitive to noise and is therefore unusable. The correct approach (made effective by <a href="http://pub.ist.ac.at/~edels/">Edelsbrunner</a>, <a href="http://dehn.slu.edu/">Letscher</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~afra/">Zomorodian</a> in 2000) is to represent the data by a multiscale family of simplicial complexes, and to measure the homology as it varies across all scales. The resulting multiscale invariants, known as persistence diagrams, are provably robust to perturbations of the data (<a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/David.Cohen-Steiner/">Cohen-Steiner</a>, Edelsbrunner, <a href="http://fds.duke.edu/db/aas/math/faculty/harer/">Harer</a> 2007).

<br/>In this talk, I will explain how these ideas may be expressed in the language of category theory. The basic concepts extend quite widely. In particular, I hope to explain how Reeb graphs and join-trees—well known constructions in data analysis—can be thought of as persistent invariants, enjoying some of the same properties as persistence diagrams.

<div class="title">Real Johnson-Wilson Theories and Computations</div>
<div class="abstract">Complex cobordism and its relatives, the Johnson-Wilson theories, E(n), carry an action of C<sub>2</sub> by complex conjugation. Taking homotopy fixed points of the latter yields Real Johnson-Wilson theories, ER(n). These can be seen as generalizations of real K-theory and are similarly amenable to computations. We will outline their properties, describe a generalization of the &eta;-fibration, and discuss recent computations of the ER(n)-cohomology of some well-known spaces, including CP<sup>&infin;</sup>.</div>

<div class="title">Characteristic classes of
manifold bundles</div>
<div class="abstract">For every smooth fiber bundle  $f: E\to B$ with fiber a closed,
oriented manifold  $M^d$ of dimension $d$ and any characteristic class
of vector bundles  $p \in H^* \left( BSO(d) \right)$, one can define a
``generalized Miller-Morita-Mumford class" or ``kappa-class"
$\kappa_p \in H^*(B)$. We are interested in the ideal  $I_M$ of all
the polynomials in the kappa classes which vanish for \textit{every}
bundle with fiber diffeomorphic to $M$, as well as the algebraic
structure of the quotient  $R_M = \mathbb{Q}\left[\kappa_p\right]/I_M$
of the free polynomial algebra by this ideal. I will talk mainly about
the case where the manifold is a connected sums of $g$ copies of $S^n
\times S^n$, with $n$ odd. In this case, we can compute the ring $R_M$
modulo nilpotents, and show that the Krull dimension of $R_M$ is $n-1$
for all $g>1$. This is joint work with S&oslash;ren Galatius and Oscar
Randal-Williams.</div>

<div class="title">Rational homology of configuration spaces via factorization homology</div>
<div class="abstract"> The study of configuration spaces is particularly tractable over a field of characteristic zero, and there has been great success over the years in producing complexes simple enough for explicit computations, formulas for Betti numbers, and descriptive results. I will discuss recent work identifying the rational homology of the configuration spaces of an arbitrary manifold with the homology of a Lie algebra constructed from its cohomology. The aforementioned results follow immediately from this identification, albeit with hypotheses removed; in particular, one obtains a new, elementary proof of homological stability for configuration spaces.

<div class="abstract">When studying objects with additional algebraic structure, e.g. algebras over an operad, it can be helpful to consider cell decompositions adapted to these algebraic structures. I will talk about joint work with Jeremy Miller on the relationship between $E_n$-cells and homological stability. Using this theory, we prove a local-to-global principle for homological stability, as well as give a new perspective on homological stability for various spaces including symmetric products and spaces of holomorphic maps.

<div class="title">Topological Complexity of Spaces of Polygons</div>
<div class="abstract">The topological complexity of a topological space X is the number of rules required to specify how to move between any two points of X.
If X is the space of all configurations of a robot, this can be interpreted as the number of rules required to program the robot to move from any configuration to any other.
A polygon in the plane or in 3-space can be thought of as linked arms of a robot. We compute the topological complexity of the space of polygons of fixed side lengths.
Our result is complete for polygons in 3-space, and partial for polygons in the plane.

<div class="title">On equivariant infinite loop space machines</div>
<div class="abstract">

An equivariant infinite loop space machine is a functor that constructs genuine equivariant spectra out of simpler categorical or space level data. In the late 80's Lewis-May-Steinberger and Shimakawa developed generalizations of the operadic approach and the Gamma-space approach respectively. In this talk I will describe work in progress that aims to understand these machines conceptually, relate them to each other, and develop new machines that are more suitable for certain kinds of input. This work is joint with Anna Marie Bohmann, Bert Guillou, Peter May and Mona Merling.

<div class="title">The Unbearable Lightness of 2-Being<br>(Title with apologies to Milan Kundera)</div>
<div class="abstract">

<p>Joint work with Dr. Emily Riehl, Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<p>For a few years now, Emily and I have been engaged in a project to study the extent to which the category theory of $(\infty,n)$-categories can be developed using some elementary tools from 2-category theory. This idea, which dates back to Andre Joyal's earliest work on quasi-categories, turns out to be remarkably and somewhat unbearably fruitful. Much to our own surprise, a very great deal of the category theory of such stuctures can be rendered directly from a study of {\em strict\/} 2-categories and bicategories of $(\infty,n)$-categories, using techniques largely developed by the Australian Category Theory School in the 1970s.</p>

<p>To date we have developed a largely 2-categorical theory of adjunctions, monadicity, cartesian fibrations, modules, limits and colimits, (pointwise) Kan extensions, final and initial functors, Yoneda's lemma, presheaf categories and many other important categorical structures besides. All of this work follows a mild re-working of a well trodden path of 2-being, which not only provides for a foundational redevelopment of the category theory of quasi-categories but is also couched in terms that is both model independent and amenable to application to $(\infty,n)$-categories and $(\infty,\infty)$-categories of various kinds.</p>

<p>One of the enduring themes in this work is the inspiration it draws from the {\em derivator\/} approach to abstract homotopy theory, as pioneered independently by Grothendieck and Heller. Such gadgets light up the theory of homotopy limits and colimits by observing that homotopy categories themselves can provide us with enough information so long as they come parameterised by {\em internal diagram types}. In this context a homotopy theory simply consists of a category fibred (or indexed) over the category of all small categories. The fibre of this structure over some small category $\mathbb{C}$ is thought of as the homotopy category of diagrams on $\mathbb{C}$ and adjunctions between fibres track the existance of homotopy Kan extensions. It is then the interplay between weak notions in the {\em external\/} world of each fibre and strong coherent notions in the internal world of abstract diagrams that allows one to develop an abstract homotopy theory to rival that available in th
